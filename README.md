# The Adventures of the gloomy forest.
My own made Python Text based Adventure game

## To play the game:

### Linux:
1. Git Clone project:

Open a terminal and type:
```
git clone https://github.com/ThirstyThursten/Text_Game.git
```

2. Check if Python3 is installed:
```
python3 --version
```
You should see a version number like ```3.5.2```.

If so skip to step 4.

If that's not the case install it by the following step:


3. Install Python3:
```
sudo apt-get install pyhton3
```


4. Make the run_Game_Linux.sh executable:
```
sudo chmod +x 'path-to-gitclone'/run_Game_Linux.sh
```

Example:
```
sudo chmod +x /home/user/Downloads/Text_Game/run_Game_Linux.sh
```
Usually it goes to your home folder:
```
sudo chmod +x /home/"username"/Text_Game/run_Game_Linux.sh
```

5. And double click ```run_Game_Linux.sh``` and if prompted click ```open in Terminal```.


### Windows:
